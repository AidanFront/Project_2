##GA WDI viiminds Project 2 

***"PET PIC"***
Heroku-hosted app.

###Problem
A socially acceptable place to put all those adorable pet pictures that you have.
Do you want to be the guy who posts 100 puppy pictures in facebook, or have everyone unfollow your instagram profile? Its almost as bad as flooding with baby photo's.

###Solution
An image hosting site made to host all those endless cat pictures.

###Models
psql hosted tables.
The site relies on two different tables.

    _User table_
    This is a table of all the user details and login information.
    The _User_ table has 3 columns. _Name_ , _email_ & _Password_.

    |Name|Email|Password|
    |----|-----|--------|
    |    |     |        |

    _Image table_
    This is a table of all the image details.
    The _Image_ table has 3 columns. _Name_ , _Url_ & _User ID_ which uploaded the image.
    |Name|Url  |User ID |
    |----|-----|--------|
    |    |     |        |

###Cool tech/beens

###Bootstrap
Bootstrap styling solutions was really helpful for buttons and was very helpfull for creating a grid layout for the home page.

###Google fonts & Font Awesome
Google fonts was helpfull for finding an approrpiate font for the application name. Very easy to link and apply. I settled for Monofett.
Font Awesome was great for finding usefull symbols. I have used the thumbs up/down symbols so user can rate images. This some far has been implemented in the GitHub version only.
