**PET PIC**
Heroku-hosted app.

##Problem
A socially acceptable place to put all those adorable pet pictures that you have.
Do you want to be the guy who posts 100 puppy pictures in facebook, or have everyone unfollow your instagram profile? Its almost as bad as flooding with baby photo's.

##Solution
An image hosting site made to host all those endless cat pictures.

##Models
psql hosted tables.
